Problem Description

XYZ credit union in Latin America is performing very well in selling the Banking products (eg: Credit card, deposit account, retirement account, safe deposit box etc) but their existing customer is not not buying more than 1 product which means bank is not performing good in cross selling (Bank is not able to sell their other offerings to existing customer). 

what action bank can take to increase cross selling?
